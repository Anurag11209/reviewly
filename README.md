## 2. Getting Started
### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
        
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the Reviewly repository and `<repository_directory>` with the name of the directory you want to clone the repository into.
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
    
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add any necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings).  The current codebase doesn't explicitly show the need for environment variables, but this is a standard practice for real-world applications.
### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js:** Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.  A version manager like `nvm` is recommended.
*   **npm/yarn/pnpm:**  A package manager to install dependencies.
*   **Git:**  For cloning the repository.
